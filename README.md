# embarcadero-mind-machine

Like rainbow mind machine, but for Github.

Keymaker:

* Keymaker walks you through the interactive process
* Create an application, or obtain temp user credentials
* Get the consumer token and consumer secret token
* Go through the login process
* Get the user oauth token and oauth secret token

what are the items?

* json files, presumably.

Shepherd:

* just creates a Sheep for each key

Sheep:

* (who has api? everyone?)
* Sheep should have a key, with parameters, and be a Sheep type or other derived type
* For example, file repair bot flock would be a flock of bots that all repair files, but all doing different things.
