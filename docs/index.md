## embarcadero classes

here are all of the embarcadero classes:

* [GithubKeymaker](keymaker.md)
* [Shepherd](shepherd.md)
* [Sheep](sheep.md)

(No Lumberjack method is needed.)

This follows the **mind machine** architecuture:

* Keymaker - takes care of authentication
* Shepherd - constructs each sheep with keys
* Sheep - uses keys to create API instance

**embarcadero mind machine** is a work in progress.
